QUESTION: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

ANSWER: Both title and constructor are String so when you declare a new DVD with a string argument, JAVA cannot determine whether that argument is title or category. In short, JAVA doesn’t allow you to do this.
